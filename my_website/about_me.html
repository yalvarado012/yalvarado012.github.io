<h3><p5><font color="white">Hiking is an adventure, especially with friends.The struggle of getting to the top while sweating and legs getting hard to lift is 
 something.It is a great way to keep yourself active, healthy, and it clears your
 mind for a while.</font></p5></h3

<h3><p5><font color="white"> The Walking Dead is an intense show it keeps me on the edge every time a new episode is on. It's all about fighting "walkers" and 
the most scary thing is not the zombies but the living fighting for supplies and
land to survive.</font></p5></h3
